    <h2>Cardio Centre</h2>
    <p>
    Cardio is short for cardiovascular, which refers to the heart. 
    Cardiovascular exercise is exercise that raises your heart rate and keeps it elevated 
    for a period of time. Another name for it is aerobic exercise. The kinds of exercise that 
    are associated with cardiovascular workouts are things like jogging, fast walking, and 
    swimming where there is no break in the routine. Exercises that emphasize stretch and 
    strength, like Pilates, are generally not considered cardio exercise, though Pilates can 
    be done in a cardio way, and can certainly be combined with cardio workouts to great effect.

    <h2>Strength Training</h2>
    <p>A method of improving muscular strength by gradually increasing the ability to resist force through the use of free weights, machines, or the person's own body weight. Strength training sessions are designed to impose increasingly greater resistance, which in turn stimulates development of muscle strength to meet the added demand. This section is equipped with the latest machines from Larous, India, which isolate targeted muscles for more specialized training.</p>
